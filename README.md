## üìç Overview

This project is a helpful integration of custom [dbt](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core) operators for Apache Airflow that works with Snowflake data warehouse.

Its custom hook and operator bring useful features suited for a dbt project running on Snowflake that you want to deploy in Airflow. These include environment variable maneuverability, error handling, warehouse configuration management, DBT command execution.

It essentially acts as a bridge between Airflow, DBT, and Snowflake, streamlining data management tasks.

`airflow-dbt-snowflake` is an evolution of `airflow-dbt` package (no longer mantained): https://github.com/gocardless/airflow-dbt/

The BaseOperator executes dbt commands while managing environment variables and Snowflake warehouse configurations. It also has a capability to handle specific errors and retry operations. Additional operators extend this base class to execute specific dbt tasks such as `run`, `test`, `docs generate`, `snapshot`, `seed`, `deps`, and `clean`. Each operator sets up dbt command line hooks and runs the related dbt command in Snowflake context. |

| [dbt_hook.py](https://github.com/carrerapcl/airflow-dbt-snowflake/blob/main/airflow_dbt_snowflake/hooks/dbt_hook.py) | Defines a hook for the Airflow framework for interacting with the `dbt` CLI within a designated environment. It allows the execution of `dbt` commands with flexibility to set environment variables, define profile directories, targets, specific dbt models, and output encodings among others. The commands are executed as subprocesses, and the output is logged. It also handles appropriate termination signals. Error conditions are detected and raised as Airflow exceptions. It is used by `dbt_operator.py`. |

## üöÄ Getting Started

This project is useful as a dependency of any Airflow implementation that uses dbt as main source of tasks, and with dbt running on top of a Snowflake data warehouse.

You can simply install this package as a requirement and use the extra functionalities of the dbt operator.
